# Jasper

Jasper provides an API, and engine, to cycle through challenges that will hopefully help identify areas of knowledge or learning opportunities in the user. The challenges are designed to increase in difficulty (or obscurity) as you answer more.

 **Demo: http://kalisjoshua.github.io/Jasper/**

I hope to add on to this library with some useful features:

  * Tracking correct / incorrect answers and reporting to a backend
  * When complete, providing a hash ID for submission with resumes
  * Scoring with questions that have difficulty rankings
  * Intentional holes in security for hacking

## Hopes And Dreams

I am not a fan of "typical" interview questions: 

  * What is your biggest weakness?
  * Why are manhole covers round?
  * Talk about a time when you failed.

First off, we're developers, we fail almost constantly. We do at least if we are following a strict TDD approach.

Anyway, I think that for developers, interviews should involve some typical every-day stuff. I think that this would help the candidate relax a little since it should be an activity they are completely comfortable participating in.

  * Code review of some of the candidates' own code
  * Whiteboard some problems (possibly current real problems the company is having)
  * Writing some code

To that end, I hope that this library can evolve into a tool that will help us break out of some of that wasted time in an interview. Besides, a lot of questions can be answered indirectly through just working with them rather than them telling a story about their perception of a past event.

## The Name Jasper

The name comes from, JavaScript Activity, Skills Peer Evaluation and Review. It's a stretch I know but the name "Jasper" is what first came to mind and then I tried to create an accronym after-the-fact so leave me alone. If you don't like it, suggest something better.
