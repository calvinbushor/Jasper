# Jasper

Jasper provides a series of JavaScript tasks to accomplish using a browser's console as an interface. The tasks increase in difficulty as each one is accomplished.

I hope to add on to this library with some useful features:

  * Tracking correct / incorrect answers and reporting to a backend
  * When complete providing a hash ID for submission with resumes
  * Scoring with questions that have difficulty rankings
  * Intentional holes in security for hacking
  * Externalize the tasks so they can be customized per implementation

## The Levels So Far

**level one**

  1. open the console
  2. call a function
  3. pass a function as an argument

**level two**

  1. pass an object with a specific method available
  2. provide a JSON string with some properties
  3. write a function to accept an unknown number of arguments and sum them 

**level three** (in progress still)

  1. handle an async event
  2. change the context of a function’s execution
  3. add a method to an object’s prototype

## Hopes And Dreams

I am not a fan of "typical" interview questions: 

  * What is your biggest weakness?
  * Why are manhole covers round?
  * Talk about one time when you failed.

I think that for developers, interviews should involve some typical every-day stuff; code review of some of the candidates' own code, whiteboard some problems (possibly current real problems the company is having), writing some code. To that end I hope that this library can evolve into a tool that will help us break out of some of that wasted time in an interview. Besides, a lot of questions can be answered indirectly through just working with them rather than them telling a story about their perception of a past event.

## The Name Jasper

The name comes from, JavaScript Activity, Skills Peer Evaluation and Review. It's a stretch I know but the name "Jasper" is what first came to mind and then I tried to create an accronym after-the-fact so leave me alone. If you don't like it, suggest something better.
